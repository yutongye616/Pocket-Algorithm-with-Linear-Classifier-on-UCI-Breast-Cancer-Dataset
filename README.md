# Pocket Algorithm with Linear Classifier on UCI Breast Cancer Dataset

## 1. What problems did you finish?
- **Problem 1:** Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Transformation (DT), including visualization of class balance, feature ranges, and correlations. Applied train-only feature standardization using `StandardScaler`.
- **Problem 2:** Initialized the model weights \( w_0 \) using Linear Regression via the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse (`numpy.linalg.pinv`).
- **Problem 3:** Implemented a fully vectorized **Pocket Algorithm** that updates weights for misclassified samples and “pockets” the best-performing weights.
- **Problem 4:** Designed and executed 10 randomized, stratified trials for each training set size \( N \in \{50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500\} \), keeping 100 samples fixed for testing.
- **Problem 5:** Computed and analyzed key metrics — \(E_{in}\), \(E_{out}\), generalization gap, and average updates — along with visualizations (EDA summary and 2×2 results panel).
- **Problem 6:** Summarized results and discussions in the report, covering:
  - **Error Rate Analysis:** Standardization improved accuracy and consistency.  
  - **Convergence Efficiency:** Standardized model trained faster and converged more reliably.  
  - **Generalization Behavior:** Standardization produced more stable performance across trials.  
  - **Sample Efficiency:** Standardized model achieved similar results with fewer samples.
